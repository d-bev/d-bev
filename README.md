## Hello there ðŸ‘‹


# Stuff I'm doing in my personal time
- Meh-jong : a traditional Riichi Mahjong game (OOP in Python), that may be later warped into a custom variation of mahjong
- Researching UE4 (and therefore learning about and practicing C++ and C#)
- A VM to run mypl programs (written in C++). This is currently in private repositories, but will be public when its closer to being complete
- Researching Godot (another game engine), as it's less intsense and considerably more "beginner friendly" than UE4


# Completed Projects
- [Android Matching Game] a Kotlin-based matching game, similar to Bejeweled
