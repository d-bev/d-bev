## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Recent GU graduate, CPSC B.S.

Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - a VM (based in C++) that was a class project
  - Getting a tech-related job
  - Strengthening my programming skills, especially object-oriented
  
Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - threeJS graphics
  - creation and design of programming languages
  - Game development; specifically level design and best work practices

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
  - just about any and all kinds of games, related tools, and general software tools
  - any and all Educational Technologies

Some of my projects:
- generic matching game (Web) : a Candy Crush parody to be played in browser (JavaScript, ExpressJS); not optimized
- generic matching game (Mobile) : a Candy Crush parody to be played on Android devices (Kotlin); optimized for (new-ish) android devices
- meh-jong : a WIP object-oriented game of riichi mahjong (Python)
- a VM written in C++ (currently WIP, but will make public when done) which contains fully functioning: Token Generator (for input stream), Lexer & Parser (used to create Abstract Syntax Trees to maintain semantic meaning), Semantic Analyzer (of aforementioned trees), Code Generator
