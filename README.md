## Hello there ðŸ‘‹


# Current Projects
- Meh-jong : a traditional Riichi Mahjong game (OOP in Python), that may be later warped into a custom variation of mahjong
- A simple and secure password generator for use in IT environments

# Things I'm currently researching
- Researching UE4 (and therefore researching C#)
- Researching Unity, but might give this up as Unity moves towards being pay-per-download
- Researching Godot (another game engine), as it's less intsense and considerably more "beginner friendly" than UE4

# Projects I've contributed to
- https://github.com/immobiliareai : most of my work was SQL database management and optimization. Though I did contribute to the app and API as well, my work is not reflected in commits (much of my work was done collaboratively with two fellow students). After graduating, I also helped onboard students that are currently contributing to the project.

# Completed Projects
- [https://github.com/Gonzaga-CPSC-Fall-2021-Olivares/cpsc-314-web-development-final-project-d-bev] my first attempt at making a matching game (with database functionality, which is broken)
- [Android Matching Game] a Kotlin-based matching game, similar to Bejeweled
- A VM to run mypl programs (written in C++). This is currently in private repositories, but will be public when its closer to being complete
