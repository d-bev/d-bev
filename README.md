# Projects I've contributed to
- [Immobiliare](https://github.com/orgs/immobiliareai/repositories?q=immobiliare) : most of my work was SQL database management and optimization, though I did contribute to the front-end as well. After graduating, I also helped onboard students that are currently contributing to the project.
- [Immobiliare](https://github.com/orgs/Pangeon-LLC/repositories?q=immobiliare) : some of my work is also captured here (we moved codebases in the middle of the year).

# Completed Projects
