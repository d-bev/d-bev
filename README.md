## Hello there ðŸ‘‹


# Current Projects
- [meh-jong] - a traditional Riichi Mahjong game (OOP in Python), that may be later warped into a custom variation of mahjong

# Things I'm currently researching, learning, and/or practicing
- Python 3.10 and OOP within Python
- Unreal Engine, Godot, Unity
- C#

# Projects I've contributed to
- [Immobiliare](https://github.com/orgs/immobiliareai/repositories?q=immobiliare) : most of my work was SQL database management and optimization. Though I did contribute to the app and API as well, my work is not reflected in commits (much of my work here was done collaboratively with two fellow students, and these commits are credited to them). After graduating, I also helped onboard students that are currently contributing to the project.
- [Immobiliare](https://github.com/orgs/Pangeon-LLC/repositories?q=immobiliare) : some of my work is also captured here (we moved codebases in the middle of the year).

# Completed Projects
- [WebMatchingGame](https://github.com/d-bev/WebMatchingGame) - my first-ever attempt at making a matching game (with database functionality, which is broken). Created in a Web Development class.
- [AndroidMatchingGame](https://github.com/d-bev/AndroidMatchingGame) - a Kotlin-based matching game, similar to Bejeweled. Created with another student in an Android App Development class.
- [password-generator](https://github.com/d-bev/password-generator) - A simple and secure password generator for use in IT environments
- [MyPL VM](https://github.com/d-bev/MyPL-VM) A VM to run MyPL programs, written in C++. I'm in the process of cleaning the code and providing better notes/documentation. Created in a Programing Languages Class.
