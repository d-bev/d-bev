## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Recent Computer Science (B.S.) graduate from Gonzaga University

Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - a C++-based VM (an extension of a class project)
  - Getting an internship or similar experience in the field
  - a research project for Pangeon LLC
  - an object-oriented game of riichi mahjong (Python)
  
Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - Videogame level design
  - Videogame development tools (specifically Unity)
  
Iâ€™m looking to improve upon:
  - object-oriented programming, specifically in Python (and maybe C#)
  - custom data structures

Some of my projects:
- generic matching game (Web) : a Candy Crush parody to be played in browser (JavaScript, ExpressJS); not optimized
- generic matching game (Mobile) : a Candy Crush parody to be played on Android devices (Kotlin); optimized for (new-ish) android devices
-
